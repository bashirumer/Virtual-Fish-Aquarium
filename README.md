Virtual Aquarium
Overview

The Virtual Aquarium is an interactive simulation built in Processing that demonstrates animation loops, event handling, classes, and physics-inspired behaviors.
Users can feed fish, toggle between day/night modes, enable trails, and interact with fish that exhibit realistic wandering and avoidance behaviors.

This project fulfills all rubric requirements for:

Realtime animation and interactivity

Modular and object-oriented code

Event-driven user input

Clean visuals and creativity
